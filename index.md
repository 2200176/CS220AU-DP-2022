# Introduction: Digital identities/Visitors and Residents
Years ago, Marc Prensky put forward the Digital Natives and Immigrants idea: If you are young enough to have grown up with digital technology, then you’re native to it. If not, using technology won’t be innate. In recent years, this theory has become obsolete. Age is not the predominant factor in the successful engagement with digital technology and the web. David White, from the University of Oxford, proposes an alternative model, the Visitor and Resident Map. One not based on age or technical skill, but on our motivation to engage.

First, we take a look horizontal axis. In this model, axes are a range of possibilities, not two incompatible options. The visitor mode thinks about the web as a compilation of tools for getting a particular job done; no social trace is left behind. For example, searching on a web browser. In the resident mode, we choose to go online to be present with other people; there is a social digital trace that remains when we go offline. For example, leaving comments on social media.
We also add a vertical axis: Personal – Institutional/Professional. This axis explains the degree of personal connection with the digital content. For example, personally I have two Gmail accounts, one related to university and the other for a more personal use.
As a student, I encountered this idea and I decided to create my own VR map. Here you can see the result:

The result really made me think about my relationship with the digital world and how it has evolved over the years. When I was a little kid, I used to search for the content I needed on the web without leaving any digital trace behind. Nowadays, it’s hard for me to think about an online activity where I don’t leave one. A clear example would be the social trace we leave when we interact with other people on social media, but the non-social content we access is also registered through user accounts and cookies. For example, a streaming platform can get an idea of my personality based on the content I choose to watch. 
Although it’s true that not all my activities leave a digital trail that is equally accessible to the public, it is curious to see how the separation between physical and digital identity is blurring, as we are increasingly developing a traceable digital identity on the web. That led me to imagine a future in which this line blurs completely, about the possible dangers that such a change could mean for our existence.
Sometime later, while browsing the web, I came across a YouTube video that caught my attention. It talks about the metaverse, a concept recently popularised by the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg.

It made me decide to try to answer the next question:

*Is the metaverse a risk for the human experience?*
